Tested all requirements of project 1 and project 2.
Tests pass and the address book is working as expected.

(See test_output)

Can add and remove items to the address book, and open
and close the program with contents persistance. Print
all and print single record works. Handles invald
input and does not crash.

I believe the overall look and feel of the application
has improved, and the address entry is now to spec.

I would like to make the menu selection more user
friendly change my make file scheme.
